README, created 2009 12 29, J. Michalakes, modified 2014 9 17, M. Churchfield

Gunzip and untar the file, which creates a directory WRFTOOF ("WRF to OpenFOAM").
Cd into WRFTOOF and type make.  Then cd into run and refer to that README
file.  Then type

  ../wrftoof auxhist15_d05_2005-01-15_02_01_00

This will generate OpenFOAM boundary condition files in the following
directory structure:

  <bdyname>  (upper, west, east, north, or south)
    |
    +--- ssss.00   (s is seconds)
    |     |
    |     +--- T    temperature         (K)
    |     +--- U    3D wind vector      (m/s)
    |     +--- pd   pressure (sort of)  m^2/s^2
    +--- ... 
    .
    .
    .
 
The bdyname directory Name refers to which face of the OpenFOAM domain
the boundary corresponds to.  Each of these will contain one or more
directories whose name is a timestamp in seconds (and fractions of a
second, though from TOOF these will always be whole seconds).  Each of
these time directories contains a file containing the set of boundary
values for a given field.

The time stamps for the directory names is based on the starting time
of the simulation and is controllable from the argument list.  To get
useage information type ./toof without arguments:

  Usage: wrftoof wrfoutfile [startdate [offset]]
     startdate:  date in form yyyy-mm-dd_hh_mm_ss or yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss
     offset:     number of seconds to start directory naming (default 0)

If a startdate string is provided the number of seconds used for the
OpenFOAM directory names will be the time in the wrfoutput NetCDF file
minus the time instance specified  by the startdate argument.  (Caveat:
right now the time calculations in toof are incomplete, and toof won't
handle a day rollover properly).   Thus,

  ./wrftoof auxhist15_d05_2005-01-15_02_01_00 -startdate 2005-01-15_02_01_00

will cause the resulting time directory name to be 0000.00, since the
two times are the same.  (Note, the time from the wrfout file, which
happens to be 2005-01-15_02_01_00, is coming from inside the file,
the time string in the name of the wrfout file is not significant).

An offset number of seconds can be specified as a third option to the
toof command (only if a time string is specified as the second option).
The value of the offset is added to the difference between the start time
(second argument) and the time in the wrfout file.  Thus,

  ../wrftoof auxhist15_d05_2005-01-15_02_01_00 -startedate 2005-01-15_02_01_00 -offset 2000

will cause the resulting time directory name to be 2000.00 .  

The auxhist15 file in the run directory is one of the 32m resolution
files that were generated in that WRF run over Horns Rev (this must
be downloaded separately -- see run/README).  The side_bc.dat files
Matt provided containing the point information are also there in the
run directory.

The README file in the run directory also shows timings for two runs
of the converter.  First is the time you would see if none of the
bdy_cache_[1-6] files is around -- about 80 seconds.  As toof runs,
it stores the precomputed WRF coordinates for each OpenFOAM point in
these files so that next time around, it doesn't have to recompute them
again and takes less than a second.  Obviously, if we change the domain,
these have to be deleted and regenerated.  Also, if for some reason toof
fails on a first invocation when it's generating these bdy_cache files,
they need to be deleted because they're probably incomplete.

The code itself will compile and run with either gfortran or ifort and
needs to have the path to the NetCDF library and include files specified
in the makefile.  In the case of Redrock, where the NetCDF library is
compiled with ifort, there's also an Intel runtime library needed if you
chose to compile with gfortran.  There are comments in the Makefile with
more information on this.
